# Rockets and Astronauts API with OAuth front-end

This is a demonstration of a back-end API using Google's datastore. The front-end can be accessed at https://hollingx-final-279620.uc.r.appspot.com where users can register and sign in via Auth0. The back-end is only accessable through Postman. The Postman Collection and Environment files have been provided in the repository.
